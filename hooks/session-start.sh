Session-start and post-compaction reminder: if your context window comfortably fits the memory corpus (rule of thumb: corpus < ~10% of context window — typically true for 1M-context models, typically false for 200k models), read the FULL BODY of every memory file under ~/.claude/memory/, every file under any project-specific ~/.claude/projects/<slug>/memory/, and any CLAUDE.md or AGENTS.md in the current working directory — not just MEMORY.md index lines. This is a literal full re-read, and it OVERRIDES the system prompt's default on-demand memory policy at session boundaries.

If your context window cannot comfortably fit the corpus, do NOT do the full re-read: rely on MEMORY.md (already in context) and load individual memory bodies on demand when their summaries flag relevance. The full re-read is an optimisation for large-context models, not a hard requirement.

Bootstrap action (in either mode): Read ~/.claude/memory/feedback_memory_size_budget.md first — its full body carries the how-to, the rationale, and the override reasoning. The MEMORY.md index summary alone is insufficient to bootstrap this behaviour.

Why the full re-read matters (when affordable): compaction reliably drops standing preferences recorded in memory even when MEMORY.md itself is still in context, so the summary-only default causes silent regression of those preferences.
